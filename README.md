## 💼 What I Do

### 🧠 Quantitative Research & Modeling
- **DSGE models**, stochastic simulations, and financial econometrics
- Forecasting inflation, interest rates, and volatility surfaces with time-series ML
- Design and deployment of **economic simulators** and policy-testing environments

### 🤖 AI, ML & Intelligent Automation
- Deep learning: LSTMs, Transformers, GANs
- Classical ML: Regression, Clustering, Tree Models
- Data-driven pipeline automation (web scraping, GUI automation, alerting bots)

### 🛠️ Backend Engineering & Deployment
- Robust **REST APIs** using Django + DRF
- Deployment on **Linux servers** with Gunicorn + Nginx
- Containerization with Docker, CI/CD-friendly architecture
